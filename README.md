# Physics-Lab

This repository contains all the data analysis done after conducting experiments as part of an undergraduate Physics Lab course. All the analysis has been done using Python, specifically NumPy and MatPlotLib packages. Conducting experiments is only half of the job; the more important part is to make sense of the data that has been obtained. And with modern computing techniques, it has become much simpler than it previously was.
